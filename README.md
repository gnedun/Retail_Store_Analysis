# Walmart Sales Prediction Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Walmart Sales Prediction project, a comprehensive analysis and prediction project for weekly sales at Walmart stores. This project involves the exploration, preprocessing, and modeling of Walmart sales data to predict future sales trends. The analysis encompasses various machine learning models and time series forecasting techniques to provide insights into sales patterns and make predictions.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several sections, each addressing specific aspects of the data analysis and prediction process. The main sections include:

### 1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing

- **Working Directory Setup:** Initial setup of the working directory and importing necessary datasets.
- **Data Joining:** Merging information from multiple datasets, including store details, features, and weekly sales data.
- **Grouping and Aggregation:** Grouping data by store and type, summarizing key statistics, and preparing the dataset for modeling.

### 2. Machine Learning Models

#### Random Forest Classification

- Utilizing the Random Forest algorithm to classify stores into different types based on mean sales, store size, and the number of departments.

#### Naive Bayes Classification

- Training a Naive Bayes model for store classification using the same features as the Random Forest model.

#### k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification

- Applying the KNN algorithm for store classification based on mean sales, store size, and the number of departments.

#### Neural Network Classification

- Implementing a neural network model to classify stores, leveraging mean sales, store size, and the number of departments.

#### Ensemble Model

- Combining predictions from Random Forest, Naive Bayes, KNN, and Neural Network models to create an ensemble model for store classification.

### 3. Linear Regression

- Building a Multilinear Regression model to predict weekly sales based on various features, including store type, size, markdowns, and economic indicators.

### 4. Time Series Forecasting (SARIMAX)

- Applying the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous Variables (SARIMAX) model for time series forecasting of weekly sales.
